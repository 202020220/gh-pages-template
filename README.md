# GitHub Pages Template

GitHub will host (for free) a website for each of your repositories. To do so you just need website files on a branch named `gh-pages` in a repository. You can then find your site at: `github.io/USERNAME/REPOSITORYNAME`.

### Fork this repository and edit the files and that's it!

This repository contains only a `gh-pages` branch and the basic website files: `index.html` and `style.css`.

When you fork this site you'll have a copy on your account. You can click the file names and edit them directly from GitHub.com.
